# Poor Names: 
### Mysterious Names :
Sometimes we use mysterious names to our code, which is not readble by other user. Even if we came back later we can't understand the identifiers purpose by looking at the name only. So that We should avoid to use that. Some Example of Mysterious Names are
```C#
SqlDataReader dr1
int od

void Button1_Click()

Class Page1{

}
```
